# Mixed-Curvature VAE for Single-Cell Data Embeddings

This repository is adapted from [mvae](https://github.com/oskopek/mvae) to embed single-cell data into mixed-curvature spaces. The embedded data can be later on used for [Federated Learning applications](https://github.com/sauravpr/hyperbolic_federated_classification).

## Installation

The required packages are listed in `environment.yml`.

## Example Usage

Please see the shell files such as `run_sc.sh` for more details.

## Contact

Please contact Chao Pan (chaopan2@illinois.edu) and Saurav Prakash (sauravp2@illinois.edu) if you have any questions.

## Citation

Please consider citing our paper and the original mvae paper if you find our repository useful!
